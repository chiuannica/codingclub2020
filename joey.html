    <h1 class="title">Joey</h1>
    <p class="desc">About me. I am Joey and I like math. When I am not busy doing math, I like to cook different kinds of food, especially BBQ. My favorite kinds of meat to BBQ are chicken and steak, but don't be surprised if you see me throwing some ribs on the grill. After all, many consider my STL style ribs to be quite elite. </p>

    <h2 class="More about ribs title">How elite?</h2>
    <p class="desc">Very elite. I like to make a dry rub that I smother the ribs in before I cook them, and like the BBQ sauce that I use to be spicy and garlicky, to give them a little kick. You might be thinking to yourself, I'm a vegetarian! I won't ever be able to taste those delicious ribs! Don't worry superstar, I've got you covered with grilled stuffed peppers. </p>

    <h2 class="4daveggies title">Still elite?</h2>
    <p class="desc">Incredibly, my grilled stuffed peppers are also known throughout the Midwest (and most of the rest of the continental US) as very elite. I stuff them with cheesy rice, mushrooms, and - if they are for some of my meat-eating friends) bacon. Then I throw them on the grill for about 30 minutes - until the individual flavors have molded together as one - and the whole snack is oh so tender. </p>
